                The Embassy of the Italian Republic conducts selective

                  The procedure for applying for a visa is individual in nature
                  and implies the performance of the necessary actions by the
                  Applicants personally, due to the requirements for the
                  protection of personal data of the Applicants.<br />
                  According to clause 2 of the Terms, “... To use any Service
                  that will be provided by TLScontact, the Applicant must
                  perform the following actions through the TLScontact website:
                </p>
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    Make an appointment to apply for a visa at the Visa
                    Application Centre.”
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                The accounts must be created by the Applicants personally and
                contain reliable personal data (phone number, email address,
                passport number, name).<br />
                TLScontact has the right to refuse to provide services, incl.
                reject an appointment, application, or document if the Applicant
                violates the Terms of Service.<br />
                No intermediary may arrange accounts and slots for visa
                applications, except travel companies accredited by the Italian
                Embassy in the Republic of Belarus, when organizing tourist
                trips operated or sold by them.
